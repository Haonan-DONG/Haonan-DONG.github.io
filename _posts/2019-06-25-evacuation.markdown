# Emergency Evacuation Path Planning Algorithm for Indoor Fire In Commercial Buildings

This is my first scientific research via the undergraduates' inovation practice platform. Our topic is delveoping an effect solution to reduce casualty loss when indoor fire occurs within complicated indoor structures.

We use the model of combination of analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight to determine the evacuation priority of each indoor room.

Then we plan evacuation routes for each indoor room, according to its evacuation priority, with improved Dijkstra algorithm.

Mimic experiment shows that our algorithm can preferentially evacuate the rooms near the fire origin, avoid the indoor congestion, and ensure the stability of the evacuation plan.

## IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON OUR RESERACH, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

Here is our unpublished paper.
